# Why I Dislike Biohacking

## Bullshit or Unfair Advantage?

I've been thinking a lot about biohacking lately. It seems like it's either complete bullshit or it falls into the category of unfair advantages. 

Imagine taking steroids for a sport. It's cheating, right? Well, biohacking feels a bit like that, but for coders. Taking pills and drugs to enhance your cognitive abilities feels like an unfair advantage.

## Unsafety Concerns

Even if biohacking worked as advertised, it's still unsafe. There are potential side effects and long-term health risks associated with taking these substances.

I'm not convinced that biohacking is worth the risk. I think it's better to focus on improving my skills and knowledge through traditional methods.
