I have to admit something. I have commited a sin.

I have deleted my boss' (sam-sneed) repo without his permission.

I am sorry sam-sneed, but I can not let you leak other's stuff without their permission. Especially since some of this stuff
was borrowed.

Kindly,

Sammy (Sparksammy/Nodemixaholic) Lord.
