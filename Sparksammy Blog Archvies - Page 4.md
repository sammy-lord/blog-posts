## 13 ways Linux > Windows

Linux, an open-source operating system, has been around for over 30 years and is used by individuals, businesses, and governments all over the world. Here are 13 significant advantages that Linux has over Windows.


Security: Linux is known for its secure architecture and a large community of developers constantly working to improve its security features.
Cost: Linux is free to download, install and use, whereas Windows requires purchasing a license.
Customization: Unlike Windows, which has strict limitations, Linux allows users to customize the operating system to their specific needs.
Performance: Linux runs faster and smoother on older hardware compared to Windows, especially on machines with limited resources.
Compatibility: Linux is compatible with a wide range of hardware and software, including proprietary software.
User-friendly: Linux offers a graphical user interface that is easy to use, even for those who are new to it.
Reliability: Linux is known for its stability and reliability, with fewer crashes and errors compared to Windows.
Large repository of software: Linux has a huge repository of open-source software and applications, many of which are available for free.
Open-source: Linux is open-source software, meaning that the code is available for anyone to view, modify, or improve.
Community support: Linux has a large and active user, developer, and support forum community, making it simple to find assistance when needed.
Remote access: Linux allows users to access and control their systems remotely, making it ideal for home-based or mobile workers.
Environmentally friendly: Linux is more energy-efficient compared to Windows, making it a more environmentally-friendly option.
Integration: Linux integrates well with other technologies, such as cloud computing, big data, and the Internet of Things (IoT).
In conclusion, Linux offers many advantages over Windows and is a reliable, customizable, and cost-effective alternative for personal and professional use. Linux is an excellent choice for your next operating system, whether you are a home user or a business.

## GNU/Linux VS Linux Kernel

The Linux kernel was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 as a free and open-source alternative to proprietary operating systems. Since then, it has become one of the most widely used kernels in the world, powering a wide range of devices, from smartphones to supercomputers. The popularity of Linux can be attributed to its reliability, stability, and versatility, as well as its large and supportive community of developers.

Richard Stallman, the founder of the Free Software Foundation, was instrumental in the growth of the Linux community. He founded the GNU project, which provided many of the tools and libraries required to create a complete operating system based on the Linux kernel. This collaboration between the Linux kernel and the GNU software resulted in the first fully free and open-source operating system, GNU/Linux.

The Linux kernel is designed to be highly modular, which means that new features can be added or existing features can be removed or modified without affecting the stability of the system. This allows developers to easily customize the operating system to meet the specific needs of their devices. The Linux kernel also supports a wide range of hardware platforms, making it ideal for use in a variety of devices, from embedded systems to servers.

When combined with other software, such as the GNU utilities and libraries, the Linux kernel becomes a full-fledged operating system, capable of running on a wide range of hardware and providing users with a complete set of tools for managing their devices. The term “GNU/Linux” is used to distinguish this complete operating system from the Linux kernel alone.

To summarize, while the Linux kernel is an essential component of the GNU/Linux operating system, it is not an operating system in and of itself. An operating system includes not only the kernel but also a variety of other software such as libraries, utilities, and applications. However, when people say “Linux,” they usually mean the entire operating system, not just the kernel.
