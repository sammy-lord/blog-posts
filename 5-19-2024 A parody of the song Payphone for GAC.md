# ***"The Discord"*** - A song to the GAC team.
## A parody of ***"Payphone"*** by Sparksammy/Nodemixaholic

I'm at the Discord, trying to call interlect
All of my work I spent on GAC
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for the group?

Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That they're not here next to me

You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now, I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it a family
But even the sun sets in paradise

I'm at the Discord, trying to call interlect
All of my work I spent on GAC
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for the group?

If "Happy Ever After" did exist
I would still be holding onto my position at GAC
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more fucking GAC reminder, I'll be sick (oh)

I turned my back on tomorrow
'Cause I forgot yesterday
I gave you my work to keep
But you just gave it away

You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I've said it before
But all of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now, I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it a family
But even the sun sets in paradise

I'm at the Discord, trying to call interlect
All of my work I spent on GAC (oh, oh)
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for the group? (Yeah)

If "Happy Ever After" did exist
I would still be holding onto my position at GAC
And all those fairy tales are full of shit
One more fucking GAC reminder, I'll be sick (uh)
Now, I'm at the Discord

Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out sittin' round codin' while you're bein' greedy with your money
Wondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
May be still at the bottom, but still, when you see me, I'm stunning
And all of my smart home stuff starts with a push of a button
Telling me had chances I blew up or whatever you call it
Switch the number to my phone, so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my show, you can tell that I'm balling

Swish, what a shame you could have done picked
You had a really good group, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw, but sad to say, it's over for
Sabrina pulled up, valet opened doors
I removed the leaks, got what you was looking for
Now, it's me who I want, so you can go
And take that GAC piece of shit with you

I'm at the Discord, trying to call interlect
All of my work I spent on GAC (woo)
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for the group? (Yeah, yeah)

If "Happy Ever After" did exist (oh, yeah)
I would still be holding onto my position at GAC
All these fairy tales are full of shit
Yeah, one more fucking GAC reminder, I'll be sick (yeah)
Now, I'm at the Discord
